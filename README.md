Track WP Contact Form 7 events in your Google Analytics. Still a work in progress.

Emits events to GA on:
- submit success
- submit fail
- submit invalid
- form abandon (as defined as at least some fields being filled out, but the form never submitted)

Does not handle multiple forms on same page.
